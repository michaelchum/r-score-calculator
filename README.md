R score calculator
========

The R-Score (CRC, or cote de rendement au collégial) is a score that classifies college (CEGEP) students in Québec. 

It takes into account the student's average in a class, the average of all other students in the same class, the standard deviation (indicating the "dispersion" from the average in the group) and how strong the group really is, taking into account the average of their high school marks from secondary 4 and 5.
